## Introduction

Located in the 4th nomos of Upper Egypt, not far from Hermonthis and Coptos, Thebes developed into two settlements on the banks of the Nile that, although in fact separate and with different characteristics, always entertained a functional dialogue that during the numerous festivals and rituals that in pharaonic times linked Amun’s sanctuaries (Luxor and Karnak) on the eastern bank with the funerary temples on the western side was manifested in all its evidence. It is therefore customary to distinguish Thebes into two distinctly different parts, Eastern Thebes and Western Thebes. This traditional division of the city, besides being justified by the different paths and prerogatives that the two settlements had during the history of ancient and late antique Egypt, represents a precise mirror of the geography of the area itself.

It is possible to follow the actual history of the city almost in parallel with the more general history of ancient Egypt. Evidence of frequentation of the area dates to the earliest dynasties, and it is probably during the Old Kingdom (2686-2181 BCE) that the western part of the city, the point where the sun sets, traditionally connected with the funerary sphere, began to be used as a necropolis. However, it was in the Middle Kingdom (2010 BC - 1640 BC) that Thebes, albeit for a relatively short period, began to take on particular importance on a “national” level thanks to Mentuhotep II (2060-2009 BCE): it was he who inaugurated the first monumental temple on the left bank, which in the following centuries would experience great seasons of construction and a dynamism not inferior to that of the work carried out to enrich the seats of Amun, the Theban god par excellence, on the east bank of the Nile. In the New Kingdom (1548 BC - 1086 BC), Thebes became the capital of the Two Lands and experienced unprecedented development: to the west, with the expansion of the royal necropolis, the construction of funerary temples and the establishment of different types of settlements, the most important of which - due to the role its inhabitants played in the expansion and enrichment of the necropolis - was undoubtedly the workers’ village of Deir el-Medina; to the east, with the continuous expansion of the temples of Karnak and Luxor. Although no longer the political capital after the Ramesside period (1291-1080 BCE), the city retained its role as the religious and cultural capital of the country and experienced a new period of political importance during the Third Intermediate Period (1086-664 BCE), during which it was in fact ruled independently from the rest of the country by parallel dynasties of Prophets and Divine Worshippers of Amun. They continued to exploit the Theban necropolis by building their tombs not far from the places where, centuries earlier, the rulers of the 18th dynasty had placed their last dwellings and their grandiose funerary temples (Pischikova, Budka, Griffin 2014). The city would no longer have reached the splendour it had at its peak, but the Late Period (664 - 332 BCE) did not coincide with a definitive decline of the site, even if it was undoubtedly the eastern bank of the Nile that showed signs of greater dynamism, particularly evident in the works carried out in Karnak by Nectanebo I (Reign 379/8–361/0 BCE), still testifying to the importance - at least on a cultural and religious level - of the ancient city. On the other hand, the progressive abandonment of the village of Deir el-Medina led, in the western part, to a more pronounced process of rupture with what had been the main function of the area, connected to the cultural and funerary sphere, as well as characterised by the presence of settlements that, over the centuries, were of vital importance for the development and expansion of the necropolis. The Ptolemaic period (332-30 BCE), in many respects, smoothed out this marked gap between the two parts of Thebes: in the east there is evidence of interventions in Karnak and Luxor by (or at least on behalf of) Alexander the Great, Filippos III Arrhidaeos, Ptolemy III Euergetes, Ptolemy IV Philopator and Ptolemy VIII Euergetes II, while on the west bank it is possible to discern traces of a resumption of temple-building activities and a significant repopulation of the village of Deir el-Medina (Vandorpe 1995; Donadoni 1999, p. 97; Wilfong 1989, pp. 93-94). It is also worth noting the persistence of sectors of the population explicitly linked to the funerary administration of the necropolis and the importance of the Theban clergy, still in this period (Devauchelle 1987; Vandorpe 1995, pp. 208-210). This “rediscovery” of Thebes in the Hellenistic period can also be intuited from the various rebellions against Ptolemaic domination, which to some extent damaged the ancient city, which, although not of particular political importance, still retained some religious and symbolic influence.

As regards Eastern Thebes, the main monuments are the grandiose complexes of Karnak and Luxor, whose thousand-year history spans from the beginning of the Middle Kingdom (with the foundation of the core of the first sanctuary at Karnak) to the Byzantine period. During the Graeco-Roman period, and then during Late Antiquity, it was around the complex of Karnak that the main settlement of the eastern bank of the Nile developed. Known as Diospolis Magna/Διὸς Πόλις Μεγάλη, the settlement maintained in its very name the close link with the god Amun, sincretically identified with Zeus, whose strict connection with Thebes was clearly recognisable in the ancient name of the city, i.e. N(i)w.t-n-Imn, “The City of Amun”. However, in Demotic sources the city was simply called N(i)w.t (“the City”), that survives in Coptic documents as ⲛⲏ. As for the toponym “Karnak”, an Arabic dialectal word for “fortified town”, it derives from “Castron of Diospolis”, a name attested in later sources (Vandorpe 1995, p. 211). The city was divided into two districts: the northern one located north of Amun’s precint, west of Montu’s temenos; the southern one located south of Amun’s main temple. The nucleus of Karnak’s complex was established during the Middle Kingdmon, but it was during the New Kingdom that it reached its apogee, when it started a great season of constructions and addictions to the core of Amun’s complex and the temenoi of Montu (north of Amun’s precint), Khonsu (south-east), and Mut (south) have been added (see Donadoni 1999 for a detailed overview of the complex). As abovementioned, Karnak maintained its importance even during the Graeco-Roman period, when around its structure the main settlement of the eastern shore developed. During the Late Antique period, the area of Karnak was occupied by the Christian inhabitants of Eastern Thebes. In particular, churches, monasteries, rooms have been added inside and around the structures of the old temple, even if it is hard to properly reconstruct the topography of the site in its various phases of occupation, because of the lack of specific studies or because several structures have been severely damaged or destructed. However, it is possible to recognize, in the structures around the first pylon and in the courts between the 7th and 8th and between the 9th and 10th pylone of Amun’s temple, some of the monasteries of Karnak (Ghaly 2017). Moreover, a church was installed inside the edifice of Amenhotep II, while other two were inside the Akh-menu and inside the hypostyle hall of the temple of Khonsu. On the walls of the temple there are also traces of graffiti and pictures dating back to the Byzantine period, one of which reports a list of archimandrites, starting with the name of Shenoute.

As regards Luxor, the other most important complex of Eastern Thebes, connected to Karnak by a road lined with sphynxes, during the New Kingdom it was mainly linked to the Opet Feast, during which the simulacra of the Theban triad Amun-Mut-Khonsu were carried in processions along the Nile. The nucleus of Luxor was connected especially to the names of Amenhotep III and of Ramses II, but the complex in its entirety retained its importance for millennia, and construction work was carried out in the area even during the Byzantine period and beyond (see Donadoni 1999 for a detailed overview of the complex). In Hieroglyphic texts the complex was known as Ip(.t-rsj.t), “the (Southern) Adyton”. In Coptic texts, the sanctuary was called ⲧⲡⲟⲗⲓⲥ ⲁⲡⲉ/ⲧⲡⲟⲗⲓⲥ ⲡⲁⲡⲉ, while in Greek sources from Thebes are attested the toponyms ῏Οφις/Ἆφις and similar. However, it is difficult to say without any doubt that ῏Οφις/Ἆφις refer clearly to Luxor. Nevertheless, a toponym Ὠφιῆον and similar is attested since the 1st century BCE to the 3rd CE and it has been suggested that it refers to Luxor (Vandorpe 1995, p. 219). This seems to be the opinion of Donadoni (Donadoni 1999, p. 100). Later, in early Arabic period, Luxor was called in Greek sources Τὰ Τρία Κάστρα (ⲡϣⲟⲙⲧ ⲛⲕⲁⲥⲧⲣⲟⲛ in Coptic). During the Graeco-Roman era, Luxor maintained a certain prestige, permanently housing a Roman garrison, mainly to defend it against incursions and rebellions that threatened it from the south. Luxor was the second most important settlement of the eastern shore, and, during the Byzantine period, it was re-occupied by the Christian inhabitants of Thebes. Inside and around the complex, five churches have been built - with massive reuse of Pharaonic materials -, the earliest one (6th-7th century) being that of St Thecla, located south-east of the eastern pylon. The best-preserved church lies underneath the Abu el-Haggag mosque, while a third church is also located on the eastern side of the temple. Two other churches are in the western side (the first one outside the court of Ramses II, the second one outside the colonnade of Amenhotep III), and both articulated in three naves. In the first of these two churches, liturgical equipment of a certain value were found, indicating that a religious community of a certain importance was established around Luxor.

Concerning the more complex landscape of Western Thebes, mention has already been made of the ancient exploitation as a necropolis, both for the burial of individuals and, above all, of sovereigns and members of the royal family. The election of the area as a true “city of the dead” derives precisely from its location on the west bank of the Nile, in the part traditionally associated with the funerary sphere. This is evident in the very toponym of Western Thebes, referred to simply as “The West of Thebes”, “The Western Region of Thebes”, “The Great West”, “The Desert of Thebes” or hft-hr nb.s (“That which is in front of its Lord”). 

The Theban necropolis covers an area of about 10 km2 and runs in a south-west/north-east direction from the rather clear border with the cultivated land in the east and the rocky plateau bordering the desert in the west (cfr. Weeks 2001; Donadoni 1999, pp. 115-118; Bonomi 1906). Nowadays, the fertile belt extends for about 3 km from the bank of the Nile. Leaving the river behind and proceeding westwards, the first monument one encounters, still in the fertile zone, is the pair of colossal statues known as the “Colossi of Memnon” that once adorned the almost completely destroyed funerary complex of Amenhotep III. Hence the name τὰ Μεµνόνεια to indicate Western Thebes in Graeco-Roman times. However, the precise origin of the name remains uncertain: perhaps it should be linked to the Egyptian mennu (“foundations, religious monuments”), a term probably at the origin of the Greek name of the “Colossi of Memnon” (Maspero 1871, p. 60; Winlock, Crum 1926, p. 4; Bataille 1952, pp. 1-21). In any case, the identification by the Greeks between the statues of Amenhotep III and the mythical king son of Aurora, Memnon, is well attested. Further to the south of the necropolis and in the strip of limestone mixed with sand that joins the cultivated area to the slopes of the vast plateau, one of the most important settlements in the history of the region is encountered: Medinet Habu (Hölscher 1934; Hölscher 1954), a village that arose in the immediate vicinity of the funerary temple of Ramses III. A short distance to the south-east is the heb-sed palace of Amenhotep III (Malqata), while following this boundary strip in a north-easterly direction one comes across a series of temples of rulers from the 18th and 19th dynasties, until reaching el-Tarif (where the oldest burials in the area are located), at the northern end of the necropolis, and Dra Abu el Naga, where many tombs from the 17th dynasty to the Ramesside period are located. This innermost belt, closer to the rocky plateau, houses some of the most famous monuments of the necropolis and several of the settlements that will be analysed here. Following the slopes of the mountain, this time from the north-eastern to the south-western corner, one proceeds through the Assasif valley to a vast area at the foot of the massif known as Deir el-Bahari, where the funerary temples of Mentuhotep II, Hatshepsut and Thutmosis III stand. To the south, beyond the necropolis of el-Kokha, the modern village of Sheikh Abd el-Qurna (Polz 2001) is the centre of the Theban necropolis: there are dozens of tombs from the Pharaonic period, mainly belonging to high-ranking soldiers and important members of the clergy. The settlements of Qurnet Murai and Deir el-Medina (one containing several tombs from the 18th and 19th dynasties, the other coinciding with the village whose inhabitants enriched the western city with monuments) connect with the southwest corner of the mountain, where the Valley of the Queens (Biban el-Malikat) begins. Finally, in the northern part of the plateau, beyond el-Qurn (the highest point of the massif, at about 480 m above ground level), the Valley of the Kings (Biban al-Muluk) extends as far as Dra Abu el Naga to the north. It is in this area that most of the royal tombs are located, probably the most remembered and studied monuments of the entire site.

Even if one merely glances at the map of Western Thebes, it is immediately clear that the area was frequented not only in the “classical”, pharaonic period, but also maintained a dynamism of no less significant in the Roman and Byzantine periods. This is evident, among other things, when one considers that many of the place names used to refer to areas of the necropolis known above all for the ruins of pharaonic monuments served to indicate monastic settlements or Christian buildings of which little remains today: this is the case of the many place names containing the Arabic term deir (“monastery”), which connotes two of the most studied sites in western Thebes, such as Deir el-Bahari and Deir el-Medina. But, apart from this minor toponymy note, it is certain that Thebes - although far from its glorious past as a capital and with a much more provincial layout - experienced a new vitality during the Roman and, above all, the Byzantine period. Far from being just a series of villages on either side of the Nile, as Strabo described it (Strabo, Geogr. XVII, 1, 46), the city maintained a certain economic dynamism and was also of strategic importance. Thebes’ fame still attracted many visitors and onlookers, who left evidence of their passage through inscriptions on centuries-old monuments (Delattre, Heilporn 2008, pp. vi-viii). New tombs had not been built in the west for a long time, but in the Roman period there are many cases of the re-use of old burials, and many mummies from this period have been discovered in excavations of much older tombs. This is the case, for example, of the Roman mummies found by H.E. Winlock during the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s excavation campaign of 1923-1924 near the wall of the temple of Hatshepsut at Deir el-Bahari (Winlock 1924, p. 32; Winlock 1942, p. 99). The occupation and reuse of ancient tombs for burials (including animal burials) from the Roman period are attested not only near the temple of the Pharaoh-Queen but also in the central part of the necropolis, at Sheikh Abd el-Qurna, as well as at Deir el-Medina, in the Valley of the Queens and in the Valley of the Kings. The presence of more important cemeteries around Dra Abu el Naga and in Medinet Habu is also attested. In this very area, in the immediate vicinity of the temple of Ramses III, stood the village known in Roman and Byzantine times as Memnoneia or Djeme, one of the two large nuclei (Vandorpe 1995, pp. 211 and 222; Wilfong 1989, pp. 96-103) into which the western part of Thebes was divided in this period. Like Deir el-Medina, Djeme does not appear as a village built in Roman times: the settlement around the temple of Ramses III dates back, in fact, at least to the XXI dynasty, and its antiquity is evidenced by the name attested in hieroglyphic texts since Pinedjem I (Reign: 1070-1032 BCE) in the form IA.t <sup>*</sup>Amt, <sup>*</sup>Amt or <sup>*</sup>Amt, passed into Coptic in the form ϫⲏⲙⲉ or ϭⲏⲙⲓ. The Byzantine period also saw a certain continuity and greater dynamism in the exploitation of the ancient structures of the necropolis through various types of installations (O’Connell 2007). Looking at the map of Western Thebes in this period one can see the presence of small nuclei of settlements in approximately the same areas occupied in the Roman period. Reference is mainly made to inhabited areas such as Deir el-Medina and Djeme, but there are many more sites where churches, hermitages, cemeteries, and monastic settlements were established, such as those of Mark at Qurnet Murai, Epiphanius and Cyriacus at Sheikh Abd el-Qurna, Phoibammon at Deir el-Bahari, Paul at Dra Abu el Naga and Deir el-Rumi on the opposite side of the necropolis, north of the Valley of the Queens.
