# Sacri Lapides Aegypti

The <em>Sacri lapides Aegypti</em> project aims to study and
document the processes of transformation of sacred spaces for
worship, identity and memory from Pharaonic and Ptolemaic-Roman
Egypt to Christian Egypt through topographical-functional
analysis and the creation of a general catalogue, in digital
form, of the temple structures transformed into Christian places
used for the production and preservation of books, as well as
their cultic function.
<em>Sacri lapides Aegypti</em> is therefore the conceptual
premise and the archaeological investigation of the ERC project
PAThs, whose aim is to define a geography of Coptic manuscript
production through the creation of a digital atlas, searchable
thematically and chronologically.
